# AJ-IAM Introduction
Unified Identity Authentication (Identity and Access Management, abbreviated as IAM) is a foundational service provided for user management and permission management, helping you securely control access to users and resources.

If you use various applications or services, such as management backends, CMS publishing systems, etc., you can use IAM's user management features to centrally create IAM users for employees or applications, and grant these IAM users only the permissions necessary to complete their tasks. Newly created IAM users can log in to services using their own unique usernames and passwords. The purpose of IAM users is to avoid sharing account passwords when multiple users need to collaboratively operate under the same account.
